# 🌾 AgriAssist-AI  
**AI-Powered Smart Farming Assistant for Rural Farmers**  

## 🚀 Problem & Solution
**Problem**: Rural farmers face low yields due to inefficient resource use, climate risks, and lack of access to modern tech/insurance.  
**Solution**: An open-source IoT + AI ecosystem that provides:  
- Real-time soil health monitoring  
- AI-powered crop/fertilizer recommendations  
- Automated PMFBY insurance claims  
- Offline-first multilingual mobile app
